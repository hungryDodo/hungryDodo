# Hi there, I'm Dodo üëã

I am passionate about building efficient, high-performance, and intelligent AI systems. My research sits at the intersection of **AI compilers**, **systems for machine learning**, and **on-device AI**.

My goal is to optimize and deploy complex AI models (especially LLMs) on resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge devices, from tiny IoT sensors to powerful mini-PCs.

### üî≠ My Research Interests & Current Focus

I am actively working on several key areas:

* **ü§ñ AI Compilers & Heterogeneous Computing:**
    * Developing compiler-level optimizations for novel heterogeneous architectures, including **AMD's Ryzen AI (CPU+GPU+NPU)** stack (ROCm) and **NVIDIA Jetson** platforms (AGX Orin, Orin NX).
    * Exploring CPU, GPU, and NPU co-design and task scheduling.

* **‚ö° Large Language Model (LLM) Inference Optimization:**
    * Designing novel algorithms to accelerate LLM serving.
    * This includes techniques like **Prefill/Decode disaggregation**, **KV Cache compression**, and efficient **scheduling algorithms** for multi-tiered edge networks.

* **üß† AI for IoT & Intelligent Agents:**
    * Building multi-modal AI agent systems for smart environments (homes/offices).
    * Researching efficient memory systems for agents (e.g., **RAG**), user privacy, and multi-agent collaboration.
